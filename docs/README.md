# Implementation of Lox programming language

Current stage includes fully working C virtual machine which covers:

- Local variables
- Global variables
- Function calls
- Function definitions
- Class definitions
- Class inheritance

C version implemented using only the C standard library.

Further steps of repo evolution will include:

- Separation of bytecode compilation and execution
- Rust implementation of lox bytecode compiler
- Turning into static typed language without types annotations as much as possible
